% EE 313 -- Python

## Python
Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively. You can learn to use Python and see almost immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance costs.

## Installation
The easiest way to install Python is through Anaconda: [anaconda.com](http://anaconda.com). This works for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and can help you install all the required packages.

On the downloads page, be sure to download and install the __Python 3.7 version__. 

## IPython
IPython is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, especially focused on the Python programming language, that offers enhanced introspection, rich media, additional shell syntax, tab completion, and rich history.


## Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document:

## [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/try)
JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data. JupyterLab is flexible: configure and arrange the user interface to support a wide range of workflows in data science, scientific computing, and machine learning. JupyterLab is extensible and modular: write plugins that add new components and integrate with existing ones.  


## NumPy
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things: 

- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- tools for integrating C/C and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

## Scipy
The SciPy library is a collection of numerical algorithms and domain-specific toolboxes, including signal processing, optimization, statistics and much more.

## Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms.
