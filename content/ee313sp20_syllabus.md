Learn more at [https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/utoutpost.php](https://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/utoutpost.php).


## Q Drop Policy
If you would like to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see [http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop](http://www.utexas.edu/ugs/csacc/academic/adddrop/qdrop).


## Religious Holy Days
A student who misses classes or other required activities, including examinations, for the observance of a religious holy day should inform the instructor as far in advance of the absence as possible so that arrangements can be made to complete an assignment within a reasonable period after the absence. A reasonable accommodation does not include substantial modification to academic standards, or adjustments of requirements essential to any program of instruction. Students and instructors who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the Office for Inclusion and Equity. The University does not maintain a list of religious holy days.

## Absence for Military Service
In accordance with section 51.9111 of the Texas Education Code, a student is excused from attending classes or engaging in other required activities, including exams, if he or she is called to active military service of a reasonably brief duration. The maximum time for which the student may be excused has been defined by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board as "no more than 25 percent of the total number of class meetings or the contact hour equivalent (not including the final examination period) for the specific course or courses in which the student is currently enrolled at the beginning of the period of active military service." The student will be allowed a reasonable time after the absence to complete assignments and take exams. Policies affecting students who withdraw from the University for military service are given in the Withdrawal section.

## Safety Information
If you have concerns about the safety or behavior of students, TAs, Professors, or others, call the Behavioral Concerns Advice Line at 512-232-5050. Your call can be anonymous. If something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Trust your instincts and share your concerns.

Occupants of buildings are required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
- Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. The nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
- Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class.
- In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, UT Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services.
- Information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found at [http://www.utexas.edu/emergency](http://www.utexas.edu/emergency).

## Mental Health Counseling
College can be stressful and sometimes we need a little help. We have a wealth of resources and dedicated people ready to assist you, and treatment does work. The Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC) provides counseling, psychiatric, consultation, and prevention services that facilitate student academic and life goals and enhance their personal growth and well-being. CMHC counselors are available Monday-Friday 8am-5pm 5th floor of the Student Services Building (SSB) in person and by phone (512-471-3515).

Alternatively, you can talk to Ms. Jeni Wade, LCSW right here in the College of Engineering. Ms. Wade is our Care Counselor and she can be reached at 512-471-8396. She has office hours in EER 2.848 for drop-ins.

If you are experiencing a mental health crisis (e.g. depression or anxiety), please call the Mental Health Center Crisis line at 512-471-CALL(2255). Call even if you aren't sure you're in a full-blown crisis, but sincerely need help. Staff are there to help you.

A wonderful resource is the MindBody Lab, a self-paced environment designed to help UT students explore various resources for improving their emotional and physical health. The Lab currently features audio and video instruction on a variety of topics, including sleep issues; food and body image; health and well-being; relaxation and meditation. Most of the material is experiential, enabling students to follow along and practice the skills as they are being discussed. MindBody Labs are located in SSB 5th floor, SAC 2.106 and NUR 3.156D.

## Title IX Reporting
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from discrimination in all its forms where all students, faculty, and staff can learn, work, and thrive. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
1. Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2. Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become involved in a Title IX investigation.
3. Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.

Faculty members and certain staff members are considered "Responsible Employees" or "Mandatory Reporters," which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator at UT Austin. I am a Responsible Employee and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without making an official report to the university, email [advocate@austin.utexas.edu](mailto:advocate@austin.utexas.edu). For more info about reporting options and resources, visit [https://titleix.utexas.edu/campus-resources](https://titleix.utexas.edu/campus-resources) or contact the Title IX Office at [titleix@austin.utexas.edu](mailto:titleix@austin.utexas.edu).
