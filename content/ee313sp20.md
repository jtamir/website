# EE 313 -- Linear Systems and Signals
## Spring 2020

## Course description
EE 313 builds a mathematical foundation for analyzing signals and systems in a wide variety of applications, including speech, audio, image and video processing as well as communications and control systems.  
Topics include representation of signals and systems, system properties, sampling, Laplace and z-transforms, transfer functions, frequency responses, convolution, stability, Fourier transform, feedback, and control applications, as well as computer analysis using MATLAB and Python.  
EE 313 feeds into several ECE specializations, including Data Science & Machine Learning, Energy Systems & Renewable Energy, and Communications, Networks & Systems.
